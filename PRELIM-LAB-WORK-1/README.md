# Bubble Sort Program

## Description
This program implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort a 10k dataset in descending order. It reads integers from a text file (`dataset.txt`), sorts and displays the results along with the time taken.

## Prerequisites
- Lastest Python version.

## How to Run
1. Ensure `dataset.txt` is in the same directory as `BubbleSort-Perez.py`.
2. Open a terminal in this directory.
3. Run the command: `python BubbleSort-Perez.py`

The program will output the original dataset size, the first 10,000 unsorted elements, and then the sorted results with timing information.
