# Advanced Sorting Algorithm Comparator

## Description
This is a GUI application built with Tkinter that allows to compare the performance of various sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quicksort, Random Quicksort, and Counting Sort). It sorts datasets in descending order and displays results with timing information.

## Prerequisites
- Lastest Python version.
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations; if not, install via `pip install tk` or your system's package manager).

## How to Run
1. Ensure `dataset.txt` is in the same directory as `Sorting-Perez.py`.
2. Open a terminal in this directory.
3. Run the command through either copying the relative file path of the code and running the command `python relative_file_path` in the terminal or pressing the run button.

The GUI will open, allowing you to load a dataset, select an algorithm, and run the sort. Results will be displayed in the interface.
